                            <span class="highlight">Our sole purpose is to help you find compelling ideas, <br> knowledge, and perspectives.</span>
                            We don't serve ads—we <br> serve you, the curious reader who loves to learn new <br> things. Medium is home to thousands of independent <br> voices, and we combine humans and technology to find <br> the best reading for you-and filter out the rest.
